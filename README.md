### Hi, I'm Fatih Samed.:wave:
        
## Fire'Em All Project
### :fire:<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B1XDMIRP_4MG1FALksdgMRc3shMba7vM/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Game Play Video</a>:fire:

#### <li>It took me 6 days to develop the project,during this time i <br>got a lot of bugs and i fixed them all.</li>
#### <li>I created a character with OBJECT POOLING in case there are <br>more in the game,may be necessary in the future.</li>
#### <li>I wanted to use multiple manager to increase readability,<br>in this way, I both prevented different errors that may occur and saved time.</li>
#### <li>I supplied the animations that are not in the package from mixamo.</li>
#### <li>I created the particle effects myself, I did not use ready</li>
#### <li>I wrote a simple vector code for gestures,I didn't want to use DoTween because it is case.<br>It would be a waste of time to write my own Tween function</li>

### :imp:Bug:imp:

#### If you press the button as soon as the character sits on the chair, the panel will not close.<br>If you do this in the editor you will get an error.(null reference exception)
