#### It took me 6 days to develop the project,during this time i got a lot of bugs and 
#### i fixed them all.
#### I created a character with OBJECT POOLING in case there are more in the game,
#### may be necessary in the future.

#### in this way, I both prevented different errors that may occur and saved time.
